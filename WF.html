<p>Warframe is a free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter video game developed by Digital Extremes for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. <br>
Warframe, players control the members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war with the Grineer,
 a matriarchal race of militarized and deteriorated human clones built upon metal, blood, and war; the Corpus, a mega-corporation with advanced robotics and laser technology built
 upon profit; the Infested, disfigured victims of the Technocyte virus, a reference to Dark Sector; and later the Sentients, an alien force of mechanical beings returning from the 
 Tau system after being driven back centuries ago. To fight back, the Tenno use remotely controlled biomechanical suits to channel their unique abilities â€“ the eponymous Warframes.</p>

      <h3>Plains of Eidolon</h3>
      <p>Warframe released an enormous map called "Plains of Eidolon" and when I say it's enormous believe me, it is for this game's standards.</p>

      <img src="Assets/Warframe/WF12.jpg" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Flight!?</h3>
      <p>With the map so large, even as a ninja, it takes time from point A to point B. so they included the "Archwing" to be usable in the plains. I told you it's enormous.</p>
